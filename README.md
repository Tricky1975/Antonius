# Antonius
Quick in file string finder

This really isn't much, but it can be handy if you need this!

Antonius is a CLI tool, so you need to use it from the command prompt.

# Compile
Antonius has been written in C++ with the Slyvina framework.
You need a dedicated directory to compile Slyvina projects and from that dir go this way
```powershell
md Tools
md Libs
git clone "https://github.com/Tricky1975/Antonius" "Tools/Antonius"
git clone "https://github.com/Slyvina/Libs/Units" "Libs/Units"
```

For Windows you can best open Antonius.sln and compile Antonius in Visual Studio. Make sure it's configured for Release and not for Debug!
For Linux I'll provide instructions later.
