# Antonius
Quick in file string finder

This really isn't much, but it can be handy if you need this!

Antonius is a CLI tool, so you need to use it from the command prompt.

Since Antonius has been coded in C# it requires .NET to run. (Required version is 4.8)

Please note that you do need TrickyUnits to compile Antonius and it needs to be in Antonius' parent folder in the folder TrickyUnits.
Like this:
F:\Projects\Antonius <- Antonius source
F:\Projects\TrickyUnits <- Tricky Units

When you download Tricky's Units, make sure you have the package for C# and not for C++, as the latter really won't work here.
